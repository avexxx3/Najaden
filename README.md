# Najaden

Najaden is a social media application built on C++, as a project for my Object Oriented Programming course.

## Features
- Create an account or log in to pre-existing ones
- Add a pre-existing user as a friend
- As a user, create posts which may or may not have an activity associated with itself
- Write comments on posts of your friends or liked pages
- Like a page from a selection of pre-existing pages
- Like comments and dislike them as you will
- Write the data locally as soon as an action is performed

## Build
Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/avexxx3/Najaden` or either download the source code as a zip.
Execute the main.cpp file either by running through an IDE or running the command `g++ main.cpp -o .najadenmain && ./.najadenmain` inside the same folder as the main.cpp.
